AutomaticGmailAliases is a Discord bot that makes it easy to create Gmail aliases for personal use. It utilizes a feature in Gmail (Google) that lets users generate aliases or variations of their Gmail account.

# Here's how it works
You activate the bot by using a command prefix ('$') and requesting a certain number of Gmail aliases. For example, you can use commands like [$g] or [$mail] [email] [entry]. The maximum number of aliases you can request per command is 30. If you ask for more than 30, the bot will automatically limit it to 30 aliases. It will then send you a .txt file containing the requested number of aliases.

# Is it useful?
Absolutely! This bot allows you to create multiple Gmail aliases in just a few seconds. Additionally, if you want, you can use the generated Gmail aliases with other bots or services for your convenience making a repetetive process a simple and automatic process.
